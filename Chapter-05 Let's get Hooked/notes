1. import { Title } from "./component/Header"; 
this is not object destructuring but only a way to extract Title component from Header component.

But we can do like this,
import * as obj from "./component/Header";
then we can use this as,
<obj.Title/> 
Same way React.Fragment is defined in React.

2. React uses one way data binding. Two way data binding makes the code unpredictable and hard to optimize as well.

3. Every component in React maintains a state. Whenever we have to use a local variable in a component we use state.
