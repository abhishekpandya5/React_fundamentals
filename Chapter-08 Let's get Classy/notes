Class based components have a mandatory render method. 
render() method returns some JSX. 

why we write super(props) in constructor?

we do not mutate state directly.

There are two phases:
1. render phase 
2. commit phase

research topic - 
why super props constructor?
why can i make componentDidMount async and not useEffect?
