npm used to manage packages.
why do we use?
becoz we need lot of packages, minified, bundler, refactoring, 
react app powered by lot of things and they are comes under npm.
==================================

dev dependency?
all the pckges my proj need
==================================

package-lock.json file?

^ & ~ auto updates the package
caret ^2.8.2   changes minor version .2
tilde ~2.8.2   only changes major version i.e., 3.

it shows the locked version and keep it safe and 
is very imp fiile
it locks the version
never put it in the .gitignore

maintains the exact version  and hash of it that it is the same version in production also. Maintain the intgreity.

to avoid uncertainities

=====================================
node_modules folder:
database for the npm
parcel will use a minifier to minify the code
minifier needs some other packages. so collectively all the files are stored under node_modules folder.

called as helper funcions / helper code

package-lock.json files helps to generate the node modules folder on the server this is why we will never push the node modules to git.
======================================

npx: execute using npm

npx parcel index.html  (here index.html is a entry point)

created development build and host to our server and creates parcel-cache folder

npx parcel build index.html (to make production build)

========================================


module can import type=module
==========================================

HMR: Hot Module Replacement

parcel is using this to reload the page
how it knows: there is something known as file watcher algorithm - written in C++

==========================================

anything which we can generate on server, we can put it in .gitignore

=============================================
Transitive dependency: dependencies using one another dependency.
we have packg managers that handles our Transitive dependency

============================================

JSX is html like syntax not html inside js
