1. JSX can only have 1 parent.
2. react Fragment is a component. It is like a empty tag.

a representation of a DOM is known as Virtial DOM.

Reconciliation:
to diff one tree from another using diff algorithm.

only re render the specific portion of the app which is found by the diff algorithm


react fiber - new reconciliation engine

never use index as a key

==================================

1. import { Title } from "./component/Header"; this is not object destructuring and a way to extract Title component from Header component.

But we can do like this,
import * as obj from "./component/Header";
then we can use this as,
<obj.Title/> 
Same way React.Fragment is defined in React.

2. React uses one way data binding. two way data binding makes the code unpredictable and hard to optimize as well.

3. Every component in react maintains a state. Whenever we have to use a local variable in a component we use state.
