if no depedency array then useEffect will be called after each render as it is not depend on anything

never create component inside another component

never write useState inside if condition because it leads to inconsistency
and also inside for loop
(because React likes concrete things, it should know what variables to track)

React gives us useState to create local state variable inside functional component. Don't create it outside. 

We can create any no. of useEffect

createBrowserRouter is a function, takes some configurations

we create appRouter from createBrowserRouter

We give approuter to RouterProvider

RouterProvider comes from 'react-router-dom'

Two Types of  routing:

Client side routing
Server side routing

All the childrens will go into outlet acc. to the router
Outlet is a placeholder

Dynamic Routing  - make use of useParams hook
