Why React is fast?

-->React uses virtual DOM. It is a representation of actual DOM.

-->React uses something known as Reconciliation where we have Diff Algorithm which find out the difference btw the trees and render only the element which is required. 

-->All these happens using a key attribute in the JSX.

--> Tree is virtaul representation of a DOM

--> React Fiber - new reconciliation engine, it came in react 16
this new reconciliation engine is responsible for diff.

--> The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.

Using index as a key is not remommended. Check below link:
https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#:~:text=We%20don't%20recommend%20using,cause%20issues%20with%20component%20state.


If childrens are different, then we don't need a key. it will identify by different tags

For same childrens, we need a key.
no key (not recommended) <<<<<<  index key (last option) <<<<<< unique key (best practice)
