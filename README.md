## 2. Difference between a Library and Framework?

### Library:

- `A Library is a set of code that was previously written by a developer that you can call when you are building your project.`

- `In Library, you import or call specific methods that you need for your project.`

- `In simple words, a bunch of code packed together that can be used repeatedly is known as Library.`

- `Reusability is one of the main reasons to use libraries.`

### Framework:

- `A framework is a supporting structure that gives shape to your code.`

- `In the Framework, you have to fill the structure accordingly with your code.`

- `There is a specific structure for a particular framework that you have to follow, and it's generally more restrictive than Library.`

- `One thing to remember here is that frameworks sometimes get quite large, so they may also use the Library.`

### `Key Difference between Library vs Framework`

> The main key difference between the Library and Framework is something known as inversion of control. Let's understand this inversion of control more in detail.

- When you import a library, you have to call the specific methods or functions of your choice so, and it's up to you when and where to call the Library.

- Here, you are in charge of flow.

- On the other hand, Framework itself makes a call to your code and provide you with some space to write down details.

- So, while using framework your framework is in charge of flow.

- In Library, your code is going to call the Library whereas, in Framework, your code is being called by Framework.

## 3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?

> A `content delivery network` (CDN) is a group of geographically distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are. Data centers across the globe use caching, a process that temporarily stores copies of files, so that you can access internet content from a web-enabled device or browser more quickly through a server near you.
