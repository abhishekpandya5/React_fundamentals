Different ways of styling:

1. css
2. scss
3. inline css
4. styled component
5. library like material UI, chakra, base UI, bootstrap

Pros:

1. Code is less
2. easy to use
3. easy to debug
4. less bundle size

Cons:

1. Initially it has a learning curve for new developers to write css fast
2. It somewhat makes code a little messy as there are so much classes written in one line.

Features:
1. In case we need to write custom css, we can use square bracket notation like w-[200px] to give a width of exact 200px.
